# Brain Web Product Vision (Minimal)

## Core feel

Brain Web should feel like a fusion of:
- **GoodNotes** (fluid capture)
- **Notion** (structured knowledge)
- **ChatGPT Voice** (continuous, conversational learning)

## Non-negotiables

1. **Minimal UI**
   - No cluttered dashboards.
   - Every panel must answer: capture, understand, act.

2. **Personalized agent everywhere**
   - Same assistant identity across voice + text.
   - Remembers user preferences, goals, speaking style, and recent threads.

3. **Conversation-first learning**
   - Voice and text are first-class, not add-ons.
   - Transcripts feed concepts, memory, and recommendations.

4. **Memory tiers with restraint**
   - Short-term → active → long-term promotion.
   - Promote high-signal items only; avoid noisy memory pollution.

5. **Actionable, not noisy**
   - Recommendations should have one-click actions.
   - Prefer 3 high-quality suggestions over long lists.

## Design guardrails for new features

- If a feature adds complexity without improving capture, understanding, or action, do not ship it.
- New UI components should be composable and skippable.
- Keep defaults calm and focused; advanced controls can be progressive disclosure.
