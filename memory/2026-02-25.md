- User identity/context: Sanjay Anasuri, senior at Purdue (data science), building Brain Web as a personal second-brain/learning OS.
- User prefers concise milestone-only execution updates and autonomous progress unless blocked.
- User explicitly enabled **autonomous release mode**: continue until code is pushed, CI is green, and demo is live; only interrupt for true blockers.
- Product vision clarified:
  - Brain Web should be minimalistic, calm, and highly personalized.
  - Blend of GoodNotes + Notion + ChatGPT Voice feel.
  - Conversation-first, memory-driven, assistant adapts to user style.
- Strategic product boundary decision:
  - Keep Brain Web and OpenClaw **linked but modular** (integrated UX, separated internals).
  - Brain Web = memory/reasoning/UI hub; OpenClaw-like runtime = orchestration/execution layer.
  - Near-term focus remains making Brain Web excellent at core value, with orchestration integrated via APIs/UI.
- High-priority learning features user selected:
  1) Confusion-to-Mastery loop,
  2) Socratic follow-up tutoring behavior,
  3) Evidence-anchored explanations.
- Reader direction validated by user:
  - active reading with understanding checks,
  - snippet-level explain-in-context side chat,
  - highlight-driven learning workflows.
- UX direction validated by user:
  - system-wide professionalism pass,
  - reduce centered/odd layouts,
  - consistent navigation and actionability.
- User wants a central Agent Ops dashboard in Brain Web with direct controls and live run status (spawn/steer/kill/idea status).
- Personal non-Brain-Web memory captured: user is also a DJ and interested in improving Rekordbox/SoundCloud matched-track workflow UX.
